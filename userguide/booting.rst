Obtaining an IP Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During boot, %brand% automatically attempts to connect to a DHCP
server from all live network interfaces. After %brand% successfully
receives an IP address, the address is displayed so it can be used
to access the |web-ui|. The example in
:numref:`Figure %s <console_setup_menu_fig>` shows a
%brand% system that is accessible at *http://10.0.0.102*.

Some %brand% systems are set up without a monitor, making it
challenging to determine which IP address has been assigned. On
networks that support Multicast DNS (mDNS), the hostname and domain
can be entered into the address bar of a browser. By default, this
value is *freenas.local*.

If the %brand% server is not connected to a network with a DHCP
server, use the console network configuration menu to manually
configure the interface as shown here. In this example, the %brand%
system has one network interface, *em0*.


.. code-block:: none

   Enter an option from 1-11: 1
   1) em0
   Select an interface (q to quit): 1
   Remove the current settings of this interface? (This causes a momentary disconnec
   tion of the network.) (y/n) n
   Configure interface for DHCP? (y/n) n
   Configure IPv4? (y/n) y
   Interface name:     (press enter, the name can be blank)
   Several input formats are supported
   Example 1 CIDR Notation:
       192.168.1.1/24
   Example 2 IP and Netmask separate:
       IP: 192.168.1.1
       Netmask: 255.255.255.0, or /24 or 24
   IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.108/24
   Saving interface configuration: Ok
   Configure IPv6? (y/n) n
   Restarting network: ok

   ...

   The web user interface is at
   http://192.168.1.108
