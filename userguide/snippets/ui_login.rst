Accessing the |Web-UI|
----------------------

#ifdef truenas
The IP address of the %brand% graphical |web-ui| is provided on the
%brand% sales order or configuration sheet. Please
:ref:`contact iX Support <Contacting iXsystems>` if the %brand% |web-ui|
IP address has not been provided with these documents or cannot be
identified from the %brand% system console.
#endif truenas

On a computer that can access the same network as the %brand% system,
enter the IP address in a web browser to connect to the |web-ui|. The
password for the root user is requested.

   Login Screen


#ifdef freenas
Enter the password chosen during the installation. A prompt is shown
to set a root password if it was not set during installation.

The |web-ui| is displayed after login:
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
The :ref:`High Availability (HA) <Failover>` status and information
about the |ctrlr-term-active| is displayed on this screen. Log in with:

* :guilabel:`Username`: :samp:`root`

* :guilabel:`Password`: :samp:`{abcd1234}`


.. note:: The default *root* password can be changed to a more
   secure value by going to
   :menuselection:`Accounts --> Users`.
   Expand the entry for *root* and click |ui-edit|. Enter the new
   password in the :guilabel:`Password` and :guilabel:`Confirm Password`
   fields and click :guilabel:`SAVE`. The new password is used for
   subsequent logins.


On the first login, the EULA found in :ref:`Appendix A` is displayed,
along with a box where the license key for the %brand% array can be
pasted. Read the EULA and paste in the license key. High Availability
(HA) systems must have both |ctrlrs-term-both| running before the license
key for the HA %brand% system can be entered. The key is entered on the
|ctrlr-term-active|. Click :guilabel:`OK` to save the license key and
access the |web-ui|.

The
:menuselection:`Dashboard`
shows details about the system. These details are grouped into
sections about the hardware components, networking,
storage, and other categories.


|Web-UI| Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user interface is not accessible by IP address from a browser,
check these things:

* Are proxy settings enabled in the browser configuration? If so,
  disable the settings and try connecting again.

* If the page does not load, make sure that a :command:`ping` reaches
  the %brand% system's IP address. If the address is in a private
  IP address range, it is only accessible from within that private
  network.

The rest of this User Guide describes the %brand% |web-ui| in
more detail. The layout of this User Guide follows the order of the menu
items in the tree located in the left frame of the |web-ui|.

#ifdef truenas
Please :ref:`contact iXsystems Support <Contacting iXsystems>` for
initial setup and configuration assistance.

.. warning:: It is important to use the |web-ui| or the console setup
   menu for all configuration changes. Do not make changes from the
   command line unless directed by an iXsystems Support Engineer.
